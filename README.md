## Introduce to this repo 

This repo contents the knowledge I have learnt in University of Auckland, Course STATS 220.  
And this repo is part of my Assignment 1 for STATS 220.  

## First Mission
The first mission is a meme I have made by using "R Studio". It is shown as a markdown fine on [Github](https://github.com/66630303030/stats220). The meme can be checked in the 
[index.md](https://github.com/66630303030/stats220/blob/main/index.md).
